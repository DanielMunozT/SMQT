# SMQT
C++ Implementation of Successive Mean Quantization Transform

This implementation was created for MiddleMatter Inc.

MiddleMatter released it as part of an article published in Toptal.com blog. You are free to use it.

SMQT.h is the implementation using the original algorithm. You should have it as a reference only, but use FastSMQT.h since it's an improvement (explained in the article) which runs much faster than SMQT.h.
